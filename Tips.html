  <main>*40 Years of Revolutionary Struggles* by Lualhati M. Abreu is a personal memoir that recounts the authorâ€™s four-decade-long involvement in revolutionary movements in the Philippines. The book provides a firsthand account of her experiences as a member of the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), fighting against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and the socio-political injustices in the country.

Abreu reflects on the life of a guerilla, the hardships of armed resistance, and the political landscape of the Philippines during and after martial law. The memoir highlights the sacrifices, triumphs, and losses of those involved in the revolutionary struggle, while also chronicling the evolution of the movement over time.

The narrative also emphasizes the resilience of the Filipino people and the ongoing quest for social justice, national liberation, and equality. Abreu's account serves as both a personal reflection and a historical documentation of the revolutionary spirit in the Philippines, offering readers insight into the motivations and dedication of those fighting for change in the country.</main>
